<!-- 
=============== -->
My current research focuses on the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems in Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence.

* **Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs)**
  * Closely related to the Traveling Salesman Problem, VRPs have wide practical applications. I have designed improved approximation algorithms for the Capacitated VRP with small vehicle capacities.
  <!-- and also studied other problems like Multidepot VRP, Cumulative VRP with Stochastic Demands, Capacitated Location Routing, Dial-a-Ride, and so on. -->

* **The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP)**
  * TTP is an interesting optimization problem in Sports Scheduling.
  I have designed improved approximation algorithms for TTP and its variants, including Linear Distance TTP and Bipartite TTP.

* **Cycle/Path Partitions in Complete Graphs (CP/PP)**
  * Closely related to the Weighted Perfect Matching Problem, CP/PP are interesting problems in Graph Theory. 
  I have designed improved approximation algorithms for CP/PP where all cycles/paths have the same order.
